# Google-Play-Data-Preprocessing
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing data from the Google Play Store, which hosts a diverse range of applications. The goal is to prepare the dataset for analysis, addressing various issues such as missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. By doing so, we aim to extract valuable insights that can inform developers and businesses about market trends and user engagement.

The Play Store dataset contains vital information about various apps, including their ratings, reviews, sizes, and prices. This project aims to clean this data systematically and answer key analytical questions that can provide insights into app performance and user preferences.
